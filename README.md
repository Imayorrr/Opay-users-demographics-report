2.I checked for duplicates but there were no duplicates.
 
3.I also checked for blank cells but there no blank cells.

4.There was a “first name” and “last name” column in the original dataset, I merge them together and I renamed it as “full name” and I deleted the first name and last name column after merging them together.
 
5.I had 11 columns after merging them together.
 
6.After I was done with cleaning and adding columns, I had 65,535 rows and 11 columns.

# Analysis insights and recommendation

# 1.  Occupation level distribution
The distribution across four occupations (Trader, Student, Business Owner, Civil Servant) is fairly balanced, with each group having similar user counts around the mid-teens.
## Insights
* Traders and Business Owners form slightly larger user segments.
* Civil Servants and Students are not far behind, suggesting Opay appeals to diverse working categories.
* No single occupation dominates, indicating broad adoption.
## Recommendations
* Develop occupation-specific financial products (e.g., micro-loans for traders, student savings plans).
* Run targeted campaigns focusing on the top two segments to increase engagement.

# 2. Gender Distribution
Male and female users are almost evenly split, male gender is 50.08% while the female gender is 49.92%.
## Insights
* The platform has a balanced gender user base, which is rare in many fintech datasets.
* Marketing and product features appeal equally to both genders.
## Recommendations
* Maintain gender-neutral marketing strategies.
* Explore personal finance features tailored to unique male/female financial behaviors if needed.

# 3.Income level Distribution.
Income groups from below 50k to above 500k all show similar user counts, with no extreme highs or lows.
## Insights
* Opay attracts users from all income brackets, showing mass-market penetration.
* The largest categories are “250k–500k” and “Above 500k”, indicating strong usage by mid- to high-income earners.
* The highest users from this category are the ones that earns below 50k
## Recommendations
* Introduce tiered financial products (e.g., premium services for higher-income users).
* Deploy savings or micro-credit products for lower-income users.

# 4. Top ten states with most users.
States such as Plateau, Edo, Imo, Sokoto, Niger, Benue, and Kaduna show high user counts, all above 1,800.
## Insights
* User distribution is strong in mid-population and economically active states, not only in the traditional top-tier states.
* Opay adoption is strong in northern and central states, not just the south.
## Recommendations
* Allocate more agent networks and merchant onboarding in these high-performing states to capitalize on demand.
* Investigate states with lower adoption and deploy market-entry campaigns.

# 5. Registration trend by year.
* 2022: 14,609 registrations
* 2023: 21,890 registrations (growth)
* 2024: 21,698 registrations (flat)
* 2025: Sharp decline to under 7,358 registrations.
## Insights
* Strong growth in 2023, stable in 2024, but significant decline in 2025.
* Possible causes: competition, market saturation, reduced marketing spend, or economic factors.
## Recommendations
* Investigate what changed in 2025 product changes, marketing reduction, or onboarding issues.
* Launch a user acquisition campaign.
* Simplify onboarding and improve referral incentives.

# 6. User by region
The North West and North Central have the highest user counts, while South East and South West have slightly lower numbers.
## Insights
* Opay adoption is strongest in northern regions compared to southern regions.
* The South East has the lowest regional count.
## Recommendations
* Expand agent distribution and partnerships in the southern regions.
* Tailor marketing to regional behavior and culture.
* In the north, introduce loyalty programs to retain the already high user base.

# Conclusion
The dashboard reveals a balanced and diverse user base across gender, income, occupations, and regions. Growth slowed sharply in 2025, which requires urgent action. Regional and state-level data show strong adoption in northern areas, while southern regions need targeted expansion.
